With your left hand you chose a video clip on the strings (a note) and you trigger it in rhythm with your right hand.

The project consists of plans and schematics to build the actual hardware, the firmware for the AVR microcontroller running on the hardware, as well as the host software written in Max/MSP/jitter

The VideoBass was invented by Swiss media artist Michael Egger in collaboration with Maïté Colin. It is a project by `[ a n y m a ]`, and is supported by the [Migros Kulturprozent](http://www.kulturprozent.ch/), for more information visit http://www.anyma.ch
