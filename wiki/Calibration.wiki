#summary Tuning and calibrating the instrument

= Introduction =

The sensors of the videobass need to be calibrated, otherwise the instrument can behave erratically. Potentiometers and jysticks have a center position. The software has to learn where these centers are exactly. Also, every time a string changes its tension - because it is loosening over time, or because you readjusted its tension - it also changes the values it sends to the computer and therefore it is important to calibrate (or "tune") the strings quite regularly - best before every performance.

There are three classes of calibration on the videobass
* [Calibration#Tuning Tuning] is performed quite often to adapt to changes in the tension of the strings
* [Calibration#Centering Centering] the potentiometers should not be necessary very often
* In the beginning you may want to [Calibration#Setup set up] certain parameters, like joystick zones.

==Tuning==

To "tune" the videobass you don't turn the peg heads, they are just to adjust global tension of the strings, see [Maintenance].

Instead you simply push the tuning button in the headstock. This launches the calibration procedure. While calibrating, just finger the lowest and the highest note on every string, and push the tuning button again when you're done.

It is possible to tune only select strings. Don't touch a string that is well tuned and it will not change its setting.

Tuning the strings will also reset the centers of the four joystick, so take care not to touch them while tuning the strings.

==Centering==
Most of the potentiometers on the videobass have a center detent, so you can actually feel where the 0 position is.
