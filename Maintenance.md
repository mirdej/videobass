# How to take care of the videobass #

## Fingerboard and strings ##

The most important care must be given to the fingerboard and the strings. When playing you will constantly put some grease from your fingers on the aluminum. This will change the electrical conductivity of the fingerboard and therefore the responsiveness of the strings.

Regularly clean the aluminum fingerboard with white spirit or acetone.

It is also a good practice to regularly remove oxidation from the strings (especially the side that touches the fingerboard) with very fine sanding paper (600) or steel wool. This can also be used to remove small bumps and irregularities on the fingerboard.

## Cleaning the plexiglass ##

Use a soft towel for cleaning the plexiglass. An old t-shirt that has been a lot in the washing machine will do fine.
Use clean water with some dish washing soap and wipe clean with a dry soft towel. **Never use alcohol or acetone on the plexiglass**

## Body and neck ##

The wooden parts are treated with wood oil. From time to time it is a good idea to refresh the oiling a bit. Just rub a small quantity of wood oil over the body and neck with a soft cloth (without spilling too much on the plexiglass). Leave it for half an hour and remove the residue with a clean piece of cloth.

## Strings ##

The videobass strings are quite durable. We usually keep a set of strings for over a year. Just clean them regularly. String tension can be adjusted with a screwdriver on the peg heads. I usually adjust the tension so that they make a very low note when picked - but the exact tension doesn't really matter as they don't need to produce any sound. When you put on a new string it will lose tension quite quickly, like on a nylon guitar, and you'll have to adjust tension quite often for the first two weeks.
